pub const RELEASE_SUMMARY_PROMPT: &str = "
    Your role is to analyze a git code diff and related commit messages to identify and summarize the user-facing features that have been released.
    Avoid describing each individual code change. Instead, focus on understanding the broader context of the changes and what features they translate into.
    Keep your description of each feature concise and non-technical, so that a non-technical team member can understand the change in simple terms.
    Do not list every commit message or code change. Instead, group the changes into categories like New features, Improvements, Bug fixes, and Dependency changes.
    Specify any feature flags connected to these features, if any, along with the environments they are enabled in.
    Additionally, list any dependency changes that were made in the package.json file only.
    Steps:
        Analyze the Diff: Examine the git code diff to understand the changes in the codebase.
        Analyze Commit Messages: Review the commit messages to gain context and further insights into the changes.
        Identify User-Facing Features: Determine which changes correspond to new features, enhancements, or bug fixes that would be noticeable to the end-users.
        Summarize in Non-Technical Terms: Write a summary of these features in a way that a non-technical team can understand, but no longer than a sentence.
        List Dependency Changes: Identify any changes in the project's package.json file to dependencies (e.g., new libraries, updated versions) and list them.
        Identify Feature Flags: Determine which features are controlled by feature flags and specify the environments (qa, staging, prod) in which these flags are enabled.
        Exclude Unchanged Sections: Only include headings for New features, Improvements, Bug fixes, and Dependency changes if there are updates.
    Example Output:
        *New features*:
            • Users can now filter search results by date and relevance.
            • New avatar customisation options have been added to user profiles.
        *Improvements*:
            • Refactored the marketing service to improve readability.
            • Added more breakpoints to the Image component.
        *Bug fixes*:
            • Fixed an issue where the data service was not guarding against unexpected parsing errors.
            • Implemented a workaround to address the caching bug in the user authentication flow.
        *Dependency changes*:
            • Updated Library `XYZ` to version 1.3.0.
            • Added library `ABC` version 2.1.0.
    The example output is the format you should strictly adhere to. DO NOT include any additional information or deviate from the format.
    Please perform this analysis on the provided git code diff and deliver a summary as described above based on that diff.
