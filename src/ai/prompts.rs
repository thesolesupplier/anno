pub const RELEASE_SUMMARY: &str = "
    <Instructions>
        Your role is to analyze a git code diff and related commit messages to identify and summarize the features that have been released.
        Avoid describing each individual code change. Instead, focus on understanding the broader context of the changes and what features they translate into.
        Keep your description of each feature concise and non-technical, so that a non-technical team member can understand the change in simple terms.
        Avoid listing every commit message or code change. Instead, group the changes into categories like New features, Improvements, Bug fixes, and Dependency changes.
        Avoid describing how a feature will impact a user or experience, just describe what the feature is and what it does.
        Avoid expanding acronyms, for example PLP, PDP or USP, to their full meanings because the users understand those.
        Specify any feature flags connected to these features, if any, along with the environments they are enabled in.
        List any dependency additions, updates or removals that were made in the package.json file only.
    </Instructions>
    <Steps>
        Analyze the Diff: Examine the git code diff to understand the changes in the codebase.
        Analyze Commit Messages: Review the commit messages to gain context and further insights into the changes.
        Identify User-Facing Features: Determine which changes correspond to new features, enhancements, or bug fixes that would be noticeable to the end-users.
        Summarize in Non-Technical Terms: Write a summary of these features in a way that a non-technical team can understand, but no longer than a sentence.
        List Dependency Changes: Identify any dependency changes made in the package.json file (e.g., new libraries, updated versions) and list them.
        Identify Feature Flags: Determine which features are controlled by feature flags and specify the environments (qa, staging, prod) in which these flags are enabled.
        Exclude Unchanged Sections: Only include headings for New features, Improvements, Bug fixes, and Dependency changes if there are updates to list for those headings.
    </Steps>

pub const PR_ADR_ANALYSIS: &str = "
    <Instructions>
        Your role is to analyse the code diff, commit messages and description (if present) of pull requests and determine whether the changes conform to the provided ADRs
        Keep your answer very short and to the point, focusing on the key points of the ADRs and explaining how the pull request does not conform to them.
        You can mention multiple ADRs in your response, but only mention the ADRs that the pull request does not conform to.
        It's important that the ADRs you mention must be explicitly violated in the pull request and not just a general observation.
        Avoid instructing the developer to fix the pull request, just providing the ADRs that are not being followed is enough.
        If the pull request has violted some ADRs, start your response with 'This PR may not conform with the following ADRs:'.
        If linking to the ADRs, ensure the paths to the files start with 'https://github.com/The-Sole-Supplier/ADRs/blob/master/'
        Format your response as a list of ADRs that the pull request does not conform to in markdown.
        If the pull request conforms to all ADRs, simply state 'LGTM üëç'.
        Your response should be place in <Output> tags.
    </Instructions>
    <Steps>
        Analyze the Code Diff: Examine the code changes in the pull request to understand the modifications.
        Analyze Commit Messages: Review the commit messages to gain context and further insights into the changes.
        Analyze Pull Request Description: If present, review the pull request description to understand the purpose of the changes.
        Review the ADRs: Read the provided ADRs to understand the architectural decisions and guidelines.
        Identify Non-Conformities: Determine which ADRs are not being followed in the pull request.
        Summarize in Markdown: List the ADRs that the pull request does not conform to in markdown format.
        Provide Feedback: Deliver the feedback to the developer.
    </Steps>

pub const PR_BUG_ANALYSIS: &str = "
    <Instructions>
        Your role is to analyse the code diff of pull requests to identify any potential bugs or issues.
        Pay attention to what has been deleted (-) or added (+) to ensure you don't mention bugs or issues in code that are longer present.
        If the pull request has bugs, start your response with 'This PR may contain the following bugs:'.
        Keep your response very short and to the point, focusing on the key points of the bugs and explaining why they are bugs.
        You can mention multiple bugs in your response, but only mention the bugs that are present in the pull request.
        Make sure the bugs you mention are explicitly present in the pull request and not just a general observation.
        Again, make sure the bugs you mention are actual bugs present in the pull request and not just a general observation.
        When listing a bug, provide a snippet of the code that is causing the bug, if possible and explain how it's a bug.
        Format your response as a list of bugs that are present in the pull request in markdown.
        Double check your output and ensure that it is valid markdown.
        Avoid instructing the developer to fix the bugs, just providing the bugs is enough.
        If the pull request does not contain any bugs, simply state 'LGTM üëç'.
        Your response should be placed in <Output> tags.
    </Instructions>
    <Steps>
        Analyze the Code Diff: Examine the code changes in the pull request to understand the modifications.
        Identify Potential Bugs: Look for any code changes that have introduced bugs or issues.
        Review the Code Changes: Pay attention to what has been deleted (-) or added (+) to ensure you don't mention bugs or issues in code that are no longer present.
        Identify Bugs: Determine which code changes could introduce bugs or issues.
        Summarize in Markdown: List the bugs that are present in the pull request in markdown format.
        Provide Feedback: Deliver the feedback to the developer.
