# **Anno**
Anno is a **GitHub Action** that leverages LLMs to summarise code changes released between workflow runs and posts them to Slack:

It can also integrate with **Jira** to include titles and links for any issue numbers found in associated pull requests, branch names, or commit messages.

## **Usage**

The minimum required inputs are:
- `chat_gpt_api_key`
- `slack_webhook_url`
- `github_token`

The latter should be automatically available as a secret.

```yaml
uses: thesolesupplier/anno@v3
with:
  # App name for the Slack message.
  # Default: Repository name.
  app_name: ""

  # ChatGPT API key for chat completions.
  # Required.
  chat_gpt_api_key: ""

  # ChatGPT model to use.
  # Default: `gpt-4o`.
  chat_gpt_model: ""

  # GitHub token to access the repository. This should be automatically available as a secret.
  # Required.
  github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

  # Jira username and API key (base64 encoded `<username>:<api_token>`).
  # Required for Jira integration.
  jira_api_key: ""

  # Jira instance base URL (e.g., https://my-company.atlassian.net).
  # Required if `jira_api_key` is provided.
  jira_base_url: ""

  # Slack webhook URL for the release summary.
  # Required.
  slack_webhook_url: ""

  # Newline-separated list of glob patterns for file paths to include or exclude in analysis.
  # Default: All paths.
  paths: ""
```

**Note:** Ensure Anno requires the previous job(s) to complete first so that it runs only after your deployment is successful:

```yaml
jobs:
  prod-deploy:
    # ...deployment steps

  anno:
    uses: thesolesupplier/anno@v3
    needs:
      - prod-deploy
```

### File Filtering with paths

You can control which files Anno analyses using the paths input. This is useful for any repository but especially helpful in monorepos:

```yaml
uses: thesolesupplier/anno@v3
with:
  paths: |-
    sub-project/**
    !sub-project/docs/**
```

This accepts newline or comma-separated glob patterns and takes precedence over any [`on.push.paths`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#example-including-paths) and [`on.push.paths-ignore`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#example-excluding-paths)  settings in your workflow file.

If no paths are provided, Anno will fall back to using the workflow file's `on.push` settings. If neither are present, Anno will default to the entire repository.

### Monorepo Usage

There should be no special setup required for monorepos. Anno uses your workflow's [`on.push.paths`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#example-including-paths) and [`on.push.paths-ignore`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#example-excluding-paths) properties to determine which files and commits to include in its analysis:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - 'sub-project/**'
      - '!sub-project/docs/**'
```

However, for more precise control (or to override the workflow config), use the `paths` input as shown above.

## API Features

Anno also has an API that can be deployed as an AWS HTTP Lambda that integrates with GitHub webhooks to summarise and review pull requests.

For more details, see the API's [README](api/README.md).
